		<h1>Tennis Court Surfaces</h1>
		<div style="color:green">
		<h3>GRASS</h3>
		<p><b>Grass</b> is the surface that tennis was originally played on. Grass courts are the fastest courts in common use. Low bounces make for shorter points.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="color:rgb(212,45,24)">
		<h3>CLAY</h3>
		<p><b>Clay</b> courts slow the ball down and produce a higher bounce. Since clay is the softest tennis surface, it is easier on the body than other surfaces.</p>
		</div>
		<div style="color:blue">
		<h3>HARDCOURT</h3>
		<p><b>Hard courts</b> are faster than clay but slower than grass. They are the most common surface in profesional tennis.</p>
