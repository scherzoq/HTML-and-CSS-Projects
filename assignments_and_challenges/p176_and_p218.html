		<h2>The Wild Swans at Coole</h2>
		<h3>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats" target="new">W.B. Yeats</a></h3>
		<p>The <span style="color:#FF4500;background:darkgreen;font-weight:bold;">trees are in their autumn beauty,</span><br>
		The woodland paths are dry,<br>
		Under the October twilight the water<br>
		Mirrors a still sky;<br>
		Upon the brimming water among the stones<br>
		Are <span style="color:white;background:midnightblue;font-style:italic">nine-and-fifty swans.</span><br><br>
		
		The nineteenth autumn has come upon me<br>
		Since I first made my count;<br>
		I saw, before I had well finished,<br>
		All suddenly mount<br>
		And scatter wheeling in great broken rings<br>
		Upon their clamorous wings.<br><br>
		
		I have looked upon those brilliant creatures,<br>
		And now my heart is sore.<br>
		All's changed since I, hearing at twilight,<br>
		The first time on this shore,<br>
		The bell-beat of their wings above my head,<br>
		Trod with a lighter tread.<br><br>
		
		Unwearied still, lover by lover,<br>
		They paddle in the cold<br>
		Companionable streams or climb the air;<br>
		Their hearts have not grown old;<br>
		Passion or conquest, wander where they will,<br>
		Attend upon them still.<br><br>
		
		But now they drift on the still water,<br>
		Mysterious, beautiful;<br>
		Among what rushes will they build,<br>
		By what lake's edge or pool<br>
		Delight men's eyes when I awake some day<br>
		To find they have flown away?<br>
